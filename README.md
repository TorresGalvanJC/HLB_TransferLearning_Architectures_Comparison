# HLB_TransferLearning_Architectures_Comparison
Comparison of the performance of different architectures to identify HLB disease in leaves of orange trees

This repository contains the transfer learning code used to classify orange leaves affected by Huanglongbing disease from healthy ones. Each code includes predictions, as well as visualizations of learning curves showing training and validation accuracy and loss for each architecture. Additionally, confusion matrices and ROC curves are provided in the Figure.

This repository contains code supporting an upcoming research paper currently under revision. If you use this code or any part of it in your research, please cite our paper:
